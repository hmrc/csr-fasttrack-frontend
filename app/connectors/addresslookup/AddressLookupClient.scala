/**
  * The following client has been take from taken from https://github.com/hmrc/address-reputation-store. The project has
  * not been added as a dependency, as it brings in many transitive dependencies that are not needed,
  * as well as data cleansing/ingestion and backward compatibility logic that is not needed for this project.
  * If the version 2 api gets deprecated, then these DTOs will have to change.
  * There have been some minor changes made to the code to ensure that it compiles and passes scalastyle,
  * but there is some copied code that is not idiomatic Scala and should be changed at some point in the future
